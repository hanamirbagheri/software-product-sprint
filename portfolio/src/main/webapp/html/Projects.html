    <h4>Hand tracking</h4>
    <p>Working under my supervisor, Dr. Sheng Kai Wu, I helped conduct experiments that test how neuromodulation using focused ultrasound could be used to stimulate motor response. Videos were recorded of rats as their brains were stimulated to see direct response in their paws.
    My algorithm finds the paws from pre-recorded videos, and tracks their movements, using the unstimulated side as the control variable. It outputs total displacement after calibration, and graphs that show overall movement.
    It also corrects for any movements as a result of natural breathing.</p>

    <h4>First-year engineering design course</h4>
    <p>In first semester, my group worked to understand and create a better system for the Eco2Go container drop-off and use at Chestnut Residence at the University of Toronto. We liaised with the dining hall manager to understand the motivations behind the current system as well as the kitchen staff to see where the system could be optimized. We also worked to create a more hygienic short-term storage solution for masks, creating a collapsible waterproof box. </p>

    <p>In second semester, my group worked to create a more accessible and adaptive hockey stick for level 3 power wheelchair hockey players who struggled with lower upper body strength. We created a spring-loaded assistive device that reduces the force of holding a hockey stick with a three-part hinge system. We worked with secondary stakeholders to understand the common disabilities of wheelchair hockey players and the motions they could perform.</p>

    <h3>STEM Fellowship</h3>
    <h4>Research paper</h4>
    <p>I worked under the direction of my mentor, Adam Groh, to write a viewpoint article about 5 Aminolevulinic Acid fluorescence-guided surgery (5-ALA FGS); a novel compound used for high-grade glioma surgery. I researched its benefits and proposed reasons as to why the novel compound should be integrated as part of the standard of care for high-grade gliomas. The article was submitted as an entry for the viewpoint competition for a chance to be published in the STEM Fellowship Journal. </p>

    <h3>Foundation for Student Science and Technology</h3>
    <h4>Research paper</h4>
    <p>I worked with my mentor, Dr. Marina Nikoloupolos, to write a literature review about Glioblastoma; an aggressive form of brain cancer. I researched genetic biomarkers and assessed whether or not they were valuable prognostic factors for patients. I also researched drugs that could be used to target these biomarkers and their potential for prolonging patient survival. Currently, my paper is being reviewed for publishing in the Foundation for Student Science and Technology Journal. </p>
